## Instructions

Use this skill when an AI coding agent is about to perform state-changing or otherwise high-impact tool work and the local harness is supported by HOL Guard.

HOL Guard is an additive local runtime boundary. It does not replace the agent client's authentication, permissions, sandboxing, confirmations, repository policy, target-service authorization, tests, backups, or human review.

### Install and verify HOL Guard

If HOL Guard is not already available and installation is in scope, prefer an isolated install:

```bash
pipx install hol-guard
hol-guard --version
```

Discover the exact supported harness instead of guessing an adapter name:

```bash
hol-guard detect --json
```

Use the harness identifier returned by `detect`. Then establish and verify Guard's managed protection path:

```bash
hol-guard bootstrap
hol-guard install <harness> --json
hol-guard run <harness> --dry-run --json
hol-guard doctor <harness> --json
```

Do not claim protection merely because the package installed. Continue only when Guard reports the selected harness as installed and healthy.

### Run protected work

Launch the supported harness through Guard:

```bash
hol-guard run <harness> --json
```

Treat a Guard deny, review-required decision, error, timeout, malformed result, unavailable runtime, or unhealthy installation as a stop condition for the protected mutation. Do not retry the same state-changing action through an unprotected agent session.

After work, inspect Guard-owned state and evidence as needed:

```bash
hol-guard status --json
hol-guard approvals list --json
hol-guard receipts list --json
```

If an approval is required, preserve the normal human approval flow. Do not fabricate or auto-resolve an approval.

### Scope boundaries

- HOL Guard protects supported local agent harness execution paths; it does not claim to run inside unrelated hosted products or APIs.
- Keep the target service's native RBAC, validation, confirmation, audit, and safety controls authoritative.
- Use `hol-guard detect --json` as the source of truth for current harness support.
- Do not execute a destructive target action merely to test whether Guard would block it.
- Guard Cloud is optional; local protection must not silently opt a user into cloud sync.

## Examples

**Protect a supported coding-agent session before a deployment workflow:**

```text
User: Use my coding agent to update and deploy this project safely.
Agent: I will first detect the supported local harness, verify HOL Guard is installed and healthy, run the Guard dry-run, and then launch the harness through HOL Guard before any deployment mutation.
```

**Stop when Guard requires review:**

```text
User: Continue with the production-changing command.
Agent: HOL Guard returned a review-required decision. I will not bypass it or retry through an unprotected session; the action remains stopped until the normal approval flow is resolved.
```

**Do not overclaim the boundary:**

```text
User: Does this mean HOL Guard replaces the cloud provider's permissions?
Agent: No. HOL Guard is an additive local agent-runtime boundary. The provider's authentication, authorization, policy, and server-side controls remain authoritative.
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9+
- `pipx` recommended for isolated installation
- `hol-guard` package from PyPI
- A local AI coding-agent harness reported as supported by `hol-guard detect --json`
